# Physics Simulation Assignment

This is my assignment for my physics simulation assignment at University. It uses NVIDEA PhysX 3.4.2 for the physics simulation and is connected with an OpenGL renderer for testing. It cab also connected with the PhysX Visual Debugger.

The assignment made us create a dominos simulation as close to real life values as possible. The dominos are 48mm x 24mm x 7.5mm and weigh 8.5g. The simulation uses joints to create objects such as windmills and balancers.
